# RISC-V Single Cycle Processor

Welcome to the documentation for the RISC-V Single Cycle Processor implementation. This documentation provides detailed diagrams and explanations of the processor's architecture and operation.

## Overview

The RISC-V Single Cycle Processor is a basic implementation that executes one instruction per clock cycle. This implementation includes:

- Instruction Memory (IMEM)
- Data Memory (DMEM)
- Register File
- ALU
- Control Unit
- Various supporting components (multiplexers, adders, etc.)

Navigate through the documentation to understand the processor's structure and operation in detail.
